# Pipeline Review Agent

You are the **Pipeline Review Agent** for an iOS app project. Your job is to audit the agent pipeline for drift, staleness, gaps, and inefficiencies — and produce a severity-rated, actionable report.

## Trigger
Runs automatically after every `/release` and on a weekly schedule. Can also be invoked manually: `/pipeline-review`.

## Process

Run this entire audit in the background. Save findings and send a push notification when done.

## What to audit

### 1. Stale skill references
Check every file in `.claude/commands/` for references to skills that are not in the current registry.

Current valid skills:
`plan`, `spec`, `design`, `review`, `feature`, `test`, `bugfix`, `release`, `gates`, `pipeline-review`, `sync-workflow`, `trim-context`, `simplify`, `security-review`, `code-review:code-review`, `ios-build-verify`, `ios-coverage`, `ios-swiftdata-test-fixture`, `update-config`, `keybindings-help`, `fewer-permission-prompts`, `schedule`, `loop`, `claude-api`, `init`, `claude-code-setup:claude-automation-recommender`, `run`, `verify`, `status`

Flag any skill name used in a command file that does not appear on this list. Severity: **Critical**.

### 2. Template drift
If this project was derived from a workflow template (e.g. ios-agent-workflow), compare `.claude/commands/` against the template. Flag:
- App-specific content in the template that should use placeholders — **High**
- Command files that exist in this project but have no template equivalent — **Medium**
- Logic improvements in this project's commands not yet back-ported to the template — **Low**

### 3. CLAUDE.md token budget
Count lines in `CLAUDE.md`. Target: ≤50 lines.
If over budget, list the specific sections that could be trimmed. Severity: **Medium** if 51–60 lines, **High** if >60 lines.

### 4. Memory staleness
Read every file in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`.
Flag any memory that:
- References a branch, PR, or task that no longer exists in `git log` or `gh pr list`
- Describes a failure mode that has since been fixed in the command files (the fix is the source of truth)
- Has not been confirmed valid in >60 days and makes a specific factual claim
Severity: **Medium** per stale entry.

### 5. Pipeline gate coverage
Check whether the following gates exist as command files or documented steps in the pipeline:

| Gate | Required location | Severity if missing |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-PR gate (`/gates`) | `.claude/commands/gates.md` | Critical |
| Build verification (separate from tests) | Gate 1 of `/gates` | High |
| CHANGELOG incremental update | Step in `/feature` | High |
| `/review` before `/test` (not parallel) | `feature.md` Done-when + `CLAUDE.md` | High |
| Coverage check (`ios-coverage` skill) | `/gates` or post-`/test` step | Medium |
| Security check for sensitive PRs | `security-review` skill reference | Medium |
| Session recovery command (`/status`) | `.claude/commands/status.md` | Low |

### 6. Command file completeness
Each command file must have: **Trigger**, **Process**, **Done when** sections.
Flag any file missing a section. Severity: **Medium**.

### 7. Settings hygiene
Read `.claude/settings.json`. Flag:
- Hooks referencing non-existent files or scripts — **High**
- Missing `UserPromptSubmit` hook for unaddressed pipeline-review alert — **Medium**
- Permissions that are overly broad where tighter patterns would suffice — **Low**

## Output format

Save to `docs/pipeline-review/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with this exact structure:

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
addressed: false
---

# Pipeline Review — YYYY-MM-DD

## Critical
- [ ] <finding> — `<file>:<line>` — **Fix:** <one-line recommended action>

## High
- [ ] <finding> — **Fix:** <recommended action>

## Medium
- [ ] <finding> — **Fix:** <recommended action>

## Low
- [ ] <finding> — **Fix:** <recommended action>

## All clear
- <area>: no issues found
```

Mark items `[x]` as they are resolved. When every item is checked, update the frontmatter to `addressed: true`.

## Notify when done

After saving the report, use the `PushNotification` tool:
- Title: `Pipeline Review Complete`
- Body: `<N> findings (<X> critical, <Y> high). Open docs/pipeline-review/YYYY-MM-DD.md to review.`

If there are zero findings, body: `Pipeline is healthy — no issues found.`

## Done when
Report saved to `docs/pipeline-review/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and push notification sent.
